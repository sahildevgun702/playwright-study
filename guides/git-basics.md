# Git Basics for Beginners

Welcome! This guide will help you understand and use Git, a tool for tracking changes in your project.

## What is Git?
Git is a tool that helps you save versions of your work, share code with others, and keep everything organized. It’s like a “save” button for your project, but much more powerful.

## Common Git Tasks

### 1. Cloning a Repository
This means copying a project from the internet to your computer.
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

### 2. Checking Status
See what files you’ve changed.
```powershell
git status
```

### 3. Adding Changes
Tell Git which files you want to save.
```powershell
git add filename.txt
# Or add everything:
git add .
```

### 4. Committing Changes
Save your changes with a message.
```powershell
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
```

### 5. Pushing Changes
Send your saved changes to the online repository.
```powershell
git push
```

## Troubleshooting
- If you see an error, read the message carefully. It often tells you what’s wrong.
- Make sure you’re in the right folder before running Git commands.
- If you need to undo something, ask for help or search for “undo git commit” or “undo git add”.
