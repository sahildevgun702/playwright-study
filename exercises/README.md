## How to Run a Playwright Exercise Test

By default, Playwright only runs tests in the `tests` folder. To run a Playwright exercise file, use this command in your terminal:

```
npx playwright test exercises/playwright-exercises/01_open_page.spec.ts
```

Replace `01_open_page.spec.ts` with the name of the Playwright exercise you want to run.
