# TypeScript Beginner Exercises

Welcome! This folder contains ultra-simple TypeScript exercises for absolute beginners. Each exercise introduces a basic concept with clear explanations and hands-on practice.

## How to Use These Exercises
- Start with Exercise 1 and move forward in order.
- Read the comments in each file—they explain what’s happening.
- Try changing values and see what happens.
- Don’t worry about making mistakes—experimentation is part of learning.
- If you get stuck, ask for help or search online.

## Running TypeScript Files
These exercises are for learning TypeScript syntax and concepts. You don’t need Playwright for these. To run a file and see the output:

1. Open the file in VS Code.
2. Use the built-in TypeScript playground, or run with Node.js (after compiling with `tsc`).
3. Focus on understanding the code and experimenting.
