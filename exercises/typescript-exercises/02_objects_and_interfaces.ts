// Objects in TypeScript
// ---------------------
// What is an object?
// An object is a way to group related information together. For example, a person can be represented as an object with a name and age.
//
// Why use them?
// Objects help organize data. This is useful in automation, where you might want to keep track of users or test results.
//


let person = {
    name: "Charlie",
    age: 30
};
