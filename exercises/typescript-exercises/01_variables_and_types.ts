// Variables and Types in TypeScript
// ---------------------------------
// What is a variable?
// A variable is a named box that stores information, like a name or a number. You use variables to keep track of things in your program.
//
// What is a type?
// A type tells TypeScript what kind of information a variable can hold (text, number, true/false, etc.).
//
// Why use them?
// Types help prevent mistakes and make your code easier to understand. Variables let you store and use information in your program.
//
// Where are they used?
// Everywhere! You use variables and types in every program to keep track of data and make decisions.
//

// Exercise 1: Basic Variables and Types

// Create a variable called 'studentName' with the value "Alice"
let studentName: string = "Alice";

// Create a variable called 'studentAge' with the value 25
let studentAge: number = 25;

// Create a variable called 'isStudent' with the value true
let isStudent: boolean = true;

// Create a variable called 'hobbies'
let hobbies: string[] = ["reading", "swimming"];

// Create a variable called 'coordinates' with [10, 20]
let coordinates: [number, number] = [10, 20];
